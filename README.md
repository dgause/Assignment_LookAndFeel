#### About
Our Website is designed to assist users in navigating the most popular apps both free and paid that are currently available.
The information is pulled from the iTunes API providing details such as author, genre, cost, ratings and description. From the
home page a user can click on the image of an app from a selection of popular apps and it will bring them to the details page.
There is also a search function where any app that is available in the iTunes app store can be chosen and details will be displayed.
There is a dashboard page that displays app store level metrics. The design followed a bootstrap style.

**I. (4 points) Content – relevance of the content on the site**

The content of the site is based on a fictional business that specializes in helping people find, review, and analyze mobile applications from the iTunes store.

**II. (2 points) Chart – use a chart to display some useful data on the site**

The charts provide App Store level metrics for a fictional dashboard, including the top 10 most reviewed apps and the top 10 highest reviewed apps.

**III. (3 point) Responsiveness – compatibility with small (mobile), medium (tablet) and large (desktop) screen sizes**

We used a custom-built Bootstrap style grid that utilizes rows and columns to dynamically flex based on screensize. Files for this grid system can be found in the /css/responsive.css file.

**IV. (3 points) Usability –ease of use and navigation of your interface end users**

We again designed our UX/UI on Bootstrap principles, including San-Serif fonts, thin text, and pastel color theme.


**V.(3 points) Design – use of at least 3 specific design guidelines and ideas for web sites**

1. The homepage is a list style page that allows the users to view a large number of apps. Each app is clickable to a detail app with more information (Note: since it's a static site, the links go to external pages because there would have been too many pages to create. Our full-stack app will direct to internal detail pages built by us)

2. Dashboard design guidelines again follow a Twitter Bootstrap style design with thin text and a light color theme.

3. Responsivness is present throughout thanks to the grid system. You can see the responsiveness in action on all the pages.

**VI. (2 points) Group development – collaborative inputs from all team members (seen from git log output). The git log output should be appended to the submission comment.**

Please consult the gitlog.txt in this repo for group colloboration.

**VII. (1 point)  Please  add  a  comment  to  your  submission,  reflecting  on  your  learnings,  total  time required and any recommendations for future assignments. Also include the git log output.**
